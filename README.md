# FBTerminal
Control your terminal through FB posts

Prefix a timeline post with : to run that command on your terminal

If you have Jrepl (https://github.com/aneeshdurg/Jrepl) on your machine (Windows only) and Jrepl.bat added to your path, the commands :start-jrepl and :stop-jrepl will do what you expect them to. Use cmd to run the script if you intend to use this feature.
